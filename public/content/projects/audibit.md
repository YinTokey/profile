Audibit is a personal project I created to address the challenge of staying current with rapidly evolving technology news. The platform delivers the latest and most relevant tech updates in an easily digestible podcast-style audio format.

I designed and developed both the web application and iOS app from concept to launch in just one month, handling everything from UI/UX design to backend development and deployment.

## The Problem

Tech professionals today face information overload, particularly with AI's rapid advancement. Many feel pressured to stay current but struggle with endless scrolling through news feeds, leading to decision fatigue and inefficient information consumption.

## The Solution

Audibit tackles this challenge through an intelligent, automated approach:

- **Smart News Aggregation**: Scrapes tech news from curated RSS sources across the industry
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Uses popularity metrics to identify the most relevant and trending stories
- **Audio-First Experience**: Converts selected news into podcast-style audio for consumption during commutes, workouts, or downtime
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Streams only the hottest updates, eliminating noise and focusing on what matters most
